# Water-Data-Downloader
Script that automates download of water quality and water level data from water.ca.gov

Recommended to use the chrome browser for the driver as it doesn't generate a dialog box every time a request is submitted to download a file.

Use Caffeine or another program (or just run it while you do other things on your computer :) ) to keep your computer active, or the script will terminate, as it takes hours to download all of California's water data.
