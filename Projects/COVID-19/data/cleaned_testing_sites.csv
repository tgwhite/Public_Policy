Calling ahead allows a medical professional to assess your symptoms over the phone and determine if you should be tested for COVID-19. To test whether or not you have COVID-19, a sample will be taken by swabbing deep inside your nose or throat, which can be uncomfortable or even painful. These samples are tested at an offsite location, and results may take several days to process before you can learn of your results. The standard cost for community testing is $87. However, with the passing of the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, everyone will be covered for COVID-19 testing and related exam costs, regardless of insurance status. Any co-pays or in-network requirements are also waived.

Answering a few quick questions will allow Atrium to give patients immediate recommendations on the next step of their care. Testing for COVID-19 is conducted without patients having to get out of their cars, which reduces the possibility of infecting other patients and healthcare workers. Healthcare providers will make appointments and direct patients to designated testing centers where medical professionals will approach the patients at their cars. These tests involve obtaining swabbed samples, which are then tested at Atrium Health’s in-house lab, and patients are typically notified of the results in approximately 24 hours. Atrium Health can test approximately 1,000 samples each day and is one of the only health systems in the nation to have this capability.

However, the CDC recommends if you’ve traveled to an infected region within the last 14 days or were in close contact with someone confirmed to have the infection and begin to feel sick with fever, cough, or shortness of breath, seek medical care. Call your primary care provider before going to a healthcare facility and let them know about your travel and symptoms to limit potential exposure to others and avoid spreading the virus.
