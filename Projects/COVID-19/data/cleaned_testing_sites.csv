When a patient contacts the office, a telemedicine call is set up. Through the practice’s mobile app, they can visit with a patient virtually to examine and diagnose symptoms. If a doctor believes the symptoms are coronavirus related, a drive-thru test is scheduled, but not for COVID-19 at first. They will perform on-site in-car tests for the flu, strep throat and other possible illnesses. The tests are conducted on-site and take about 15 minutes. Depending on those results, the physician will call the patient and advise them on whether a coronavirus test is needed.

However, the CDC recommends if you’ve traveled to an infected region within the last 14 days or were in close contact with someone confirmed to have the infection and begin to feel sick with fever, cough, or shortness of breath, seek medical care. Call your primary care provider before going to a healthcare facility and let them know about your travel and symptoms to limit potential exposure to others and avoid spreading the virus. If you don't meet the CDC's criteria for COVID-19 but are still concerned or have questions, you can speak directly with a provider through UMC Virtual Visits to receive specific care recommendations.
